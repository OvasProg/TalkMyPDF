# 📝 TalkMyPDF

TalkMyPDF is an AI-powered Flask web application that allows users to upload PDF documents, then interact with them using a variety of smart tools:
- 🔍 Summarize long documents
- ❓ Generate 5 AI-curated questions
- 🌍 Translate text into multiple languages
- 🗣️ Convert text to speech (MP3 download)
- 📥 Export results as PDF or audio

It’s built with modularity, security, and scalability in mind — powered by Cohere AI, Google Cloud TTS, and PostgreSQL.


## 🚀 Features

### 📂 Upload & Process PDFs

### 🧾 Export as PDF

All outputs (summary, questions, translations) can be downloaded in PDF format using proper language support fonts.

### 🧠 Smart Daily Limits

Each logged-in user can use every functionality up to 3 times per day.
- Limits reset automatically every new UTC day
- Usage is stored securely in PostgreSQL

### 🔐 Secure Authorization
- Uses Argon2 hashing for storing passwords
- Requires strong passwords (uppercase, lowercase, digits, special symbols)
- Keeps user logged in via 7-day secure cookies

## 🧱 Project Structure

Your application is modular and well-organized:
```
TalkMyPDF_v2/
├── app/
│   ├── auth/          # Login & signup logic
│   ├── dashboard/     # Core features: summary, audio, questions, translation
│   ├── errors/        # Custom error handlers
│   ├── static/        # CSS, fonts, images
│   ├── templates/     # HTML pages
│   ├── utils/         # PDF parsing, audio, summarization, limits, translation
│   ├── models.py      # SQLAlchemy models
│   └── __init__.py    # App factory with config and blueprints
├── migrations/        # Alembic migrations for PostgreSQL
├── tests/             # Unit & integration test suites
├── run.py             # App runner
├── forms.py           # Login & signup forms
├── requirements.txt   # Dependencies
├── .env.example       # Environment variable template
├── README.md          # This file
```
This clean structure enables fast debugging and allows independent updates to features like summarization, translation, etc.
